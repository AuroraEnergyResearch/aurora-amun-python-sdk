# Aurora Amun SDK
**This is under development and not for general use.**

## Structure
- `aurora` contains the SDK code
- `docs` is the built docusaurus site. This directory hosts the files that are served by GitHub pages. To update this folder with new changes run `npm run build` within the `docusaurus-site` directory
- `docusaurus-site` is the codebase for managing the documentation website. You can use React or Markdown to create and modify the theme and content of the site. Some of the documentation pages are autogenerated by pydoc. Run `pydoc-markdown` in the root of this repository and it will look inside the `aurora` directory and create documentation .md files within `docusaurus-site/docs/Reference` based in Python doc strings in the code
- `examples` is a directory with miscellaneous examples for how to use Amun Python SDK

## Developing

### Create a venv and activate if required

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
#enable python virtual environment
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### Install dependencies

```powershell
# This install this module as symlinks to and all dependencies including the ones needed locally.
# It uses setup.py to find dependancies.
pip install -e  .[development] # This install this module as symlinks to and all dependencies including the ones needed locally.
```

### Building the documentation

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pydoc-markdown
```

This expected the documentation [aurora-amun-python-sdk-docs](https://auroraenergyresearch.github.io/aurora-amun-python-sdk-docs/) to be checked out as a sibling in `..\aurora-amun-python-sdk-docs\`
